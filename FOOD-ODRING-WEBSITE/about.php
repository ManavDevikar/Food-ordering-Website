A few lines that tell the story behind the food on the plate and evoke senses in the reader while recounting the ingredients and the process of creating the masterpiece can be considered as a functional item description. However, easier than said than done, creating a perfect balance between appetizing sounding story, yet keeping it short and exciting is can be quite tricky.

Try to surpass the jargon of writing appealing restaurant menu descriptions using these simple tips!

<H3>1. Talk about the Appearance, Texture, and Taste of the Dish</H3>
The restaurant menu description of the dish should ideally paint a picture to the reader about what the dish looks like, what its texture is, and how it would taste. Words such as vibrant, leafy, encrusted, buttered, etc., lend a luxurious appearance to the dish. Rich, creamy, delicious, tender, sweet, and more give an excellent feel to the dish by mere words.

<H3> 2. Emphasize The Fine Quality Of Your Exotic (Read Expensive) Ingredients</H3>
If you are serving some of the finest and most expensive exotic items on the menu, you might as well mention it in the restaurant menu description. An unusual item on the menu automatically lends exclusivity to it. Not only would this tempt your customers to order an exclusive thing, but the clear lines would also help in justifying the high selling price.

Italian restaurant Artusi Ristorante does it quite well with their description of their dish Tomino-

“Finest imported soft cheese gently melting over toasted bread with sauteed mushrooms and Italian white truffle oil.”

<H3>3. Underline the Painstakingly Taken Effort to Create the Dish</H3>
As soon as you mention the extra efforts required to prepare a particular dish, it automatically becomes special. Especially in fine-dine restaurants, customers come for the entire guest experience.</p>
